#### [My Resume](http://jhathaway.io/resume/2022.pdf)
#### Classes and Materials

I use our [byuistats organization](https://github.com/byuistats) to host most of our data science curriculum at BYU-I. The [public facing course sites](https://byuidatascience.github.io/services/) allow you to see some details of the courses. Some of the statistics faculty host their material there as well.

I use our [byuidatascience organization](https://github.com/byuidatascience) to host data that we use in our courses as well as [my port of the R for data science book into Python](https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/).

My current _'work in progress'_ course is [Big Data Programming and Analytics](https://github.com/BYUIbigdata). 

During Fall 2021 I was a visiting teaching fellow at Kennesaw State University. Here is the [special topics course on data science in R and Python](https://github.com/KSUDS) that I taught.

You can read more about the BYU-I Data Science Program using our [BYU-I data science program website](https://byuidatascience.github.io/)

#### Consulting

Our data science program integrates company work into our courses.  [Statistical and Data Science Consulting](https://github.com/BYUIDSconsulting) works in collaboration with the [RBDCenter](https://www.rbdcenter.org/data-analytics/) to offer experiences to undergraduate students and industry partners.

- [BYU-I Data Science Consulting](https://byuidsconsulting.github.io/aboutus/)

In addition, I consult on varied data science applications and environmental sampling under [DataDriven Llc.](http://datadriventeam.com/) and [DataThink.io](https://datathink.io/). 

- __Data Visualization:__ I specialize in ggplot2 programming and the principles of data visualization. 
- __Tidyverse Programming:__ You can't visualize complex data without being very handy with dplyr, tidyr, and the other packages of the tidyverse.
- __Pyspark and Big Data Programming:__ My current heavy consulting focuses on medical records data at scale.
- __Statistical and Machine Learning Analytics:__ A strong background in machine learning and statistical modeling.
- __Sample size design:__ For ten years, I was a lead statistician on [Visual Sample Plan](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/visual-sample-plan) and managed it for a little over a year before I moved to academia.
